JXD393 "Space Trek Defiant" drones development
==============================================

Here is a small example to get you started building alternative firmware for the STM8S005K6 chip inside the JXD393 drones.
More details can be found at the [CCC wiki](https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/wiki/Projects:Quadcopter_drone_modding).

This includes the [STM8S standard peripheral driver](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM147/CL1794/SC1807/SS1754/PF258009) in the source tree, as well as an nRF24l01 driver by [LonelyWolf](http://github.com/LonelyWolf/stm8/).

Working/tested features:
 * LEDs
 * SPI
